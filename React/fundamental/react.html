all react project will have three things:
    a root div;
    react source file;
    an index.js file;


In react, if something needs to dynamic change need to be in state.
setState is asyn function.

onSubmit or any event ALWAYS takes a callback function, its just whether its an anonymous function or a reference to an existing function
remember callback functions != anonymous functions, it just means any function passed in as a parameter that will then be called at a later time
